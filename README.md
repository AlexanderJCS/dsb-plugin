# DSB (Dendritic Spine Beheader)

A Dragonfly 3D World plugin written at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. It provides a fast, semi-automatic method for separating dendritic spine heads from their respective spines on a neuron's dendrite. By separating the spine head, this tool allows a neuroscience researcher to quickly and accurately find the volume of a dendritic spine head.

## Features
* Preprocessing
  * Data preprocessing done automatically and saved to a `.dsb` file for later use
* Analysis
  * Automatically suggests a point to behead with easy human adjustment by dragging a slider, moving the beheading point along the spine
* Visualization
  * Optionally visualize annotations labelling synapses for automatic inference of dendrite names
  * Optionally visualize the postsynaptic densities (PSDs) segmented to help understand where the synapse is on the dendritic spine
* Output
  * Automatically CSV file with the dendritic spine head name and volume
